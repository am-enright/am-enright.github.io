### Stories

##### Template / Blank
	- Story: Background -> action -> result

### Story 1: Innovating to solve the question of scales which plagues environmental science and remediation
	
Monitoring microbial reactions in the environment is extremely difficult and expensive -> designed a sensor-based, in situ method for obtaining the same level of knowledge -> Discovered a bio signature, and developed innovative remediation technology 

### Story 2: Raising funding
	
Grant writing -> wrote successfully funded grants for institutional, municipal, provincial, and federal funding agencies -> Raised over $600k in research funding

### Story 3: Managing a lab
	
Building and managing a lab space -> raised money to purchase equipment, wrote policies and obtained compliance with relevant policies and laws for safety -> Lab is fully certified and running Raised $400k, implemented 4 biosafety certificates, trained 5 HQP

### Story 4: Supervising students and research projects
	
Research is carried out by grad students and trainees -> design research projects, train students to perform techniques, supervise data analysis and research outputs -> Train new HQP, create new knowledge (trained 14 scientists)

### Story 5: Design and deliver courses

Professors teach -> designed and delivered online and in-person courses -> Students were trained and able to complete their degrees (taught over 200 students)

### Story 6: Carrying out research projects and communicating results

Research projects are made up of individual experiments designed to answer a question that helps solve a problem ->  designed and performed experiments using a wide variety of lab- and field-based scientific techniques, analyzed the data and used statistical analysis to validate results and assess data quality -> High-quality experiments advance human knowledge enabling better policy, innovation, and safer communities
